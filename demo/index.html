            <p class="text-intro">Art is the only way to run away without leaving home.</p>
            <p>Do you spend lectures doodling in your notebook and have a knack for bringing to life with those colors,
                a Kodak moment? Do you think out of the box and explore the very frontiers of human creativity? Lose
                yourself and drown in the colours of the world. Create that which cannot be explained but only
                experienced. An artist would not be an artist if the world appeared normal. With a plethora of unique
                competitions like 3-D Painting, Doodling, Sketching, Painting and Rapid Rounds, Fine Arts at Mood Indigo
                is where you’re restricted only by the boundaries in your own mind!</p>

                From bongos to tablas to drums, from harps to violins to guitars and what not at this year’s Music

                revive the melody inside you. With music making its foray through the wilderness of ghazals and khayals,
                pop and rock, classical and western, and not to forget fusion, we present an experience
                unprecedented! </p>
